                        <p>By ISTQB glossary the definition of a test strategy is â€“ a document describing the scope,
                            approach, resources and
                            schedule of intended test activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Test Plan is a dynamic document. The success of a testing project depends upon a
                            well-written Test Plan document
                            that is current at all times. Test Plan is more or less like a blueprint of how the testing
                            activity is going to
                            take place in a project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process of writing a test strategy is more about thinking about risk factors within the
                            project and planning to
                            mitigate those risks, rather than ticking boxes to show that all types of testing have been
                            included.

                        <p>QA team should get involved while the scope of the project is gathered from the
                            customer/client in the form of business requirements. But in the real world, that is not the
                            case. From a
                            practical point of view, the involvement of the QA team is NIL. At the end of this phase,
                            BRD is finalized and a
                            basic Project Plan is created.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Define</b></p>
                        <p>SRS is created from the BRD. Test plan's initial draft is created. At this point, since the
                            QA
                            team is not done with the SRS review, the scope of testing is not clear. So, the TP at this
                            phase will only
                            contain information on when testing is going to happen, project information and the team
                            information (if we have
                            it).

                        information on what to test and a good estimate of how many test cases we might get etc. A
                        second version of the
                        Test plan is created incorporating all this information.

                        <p>Planning a test is the core important section in the testing cycle. The outcome of the
                            testing phase will be
                            determined by the quality and scope of the planning that has been done for the testing.
                        </p>
                        <img src="../images/articles/test-plan-test-planning.jpg" alt="test-planning-time">
                        <p>Planning the test usually occurs during the development phase in order to save the lead time
                            for test execution
                            upon mutual agreement from all the parties involved.</p>

                        <h5>Major Components in the Planning Phase</h5>
                        <p>Given below are the major components that are involved in the planning phase.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Test Strategy:</b> This is one of the most important sections that can explain the
                            strategy that will be used
                            while testing.</p>
                        <p><b>Test Coverage:</b> This is essentially required and it will do conformance mapping of the
                            business needs and the
                            test cases so that one can ensure if the entire software has been tested or not.</p>
                        <p><b>Test Cycles and Durations: </b> This can become very critical depending upon the rounds of
                            development and their
                            time for completing each round.</p>
                        <p><b>Pass/Fail Criteria:</b> It is very much required one in which the pass and fail criteria
                            are defined. A few times
                            this will also be defined by the clients.</p>
                        <p><b>Business and Technical Requirements:</b> Need to have the software and the purposes they
                            serve will be clearly
                            defined along with the low-level explanations.</p>

                        <h5>Limitations</h5>
                        <p>There are few things that can actually control the software testing phase especially the
                            planning phase.<br>
                            Following are such few areas:
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Features to be and not to be tested:</b> This will clearly point out what has to be tested
                            and what should not be.</p>
                        <p><b>Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements:</b> This is the decision-maker on the
                            software developed and the criteria defined in order to suspend the testing or resume the
                            testing.</p>
                        <p><b>Responsibilities:</b> A tester will have multiple responsibilities in ensuring the issues,
                            bugs, and defects in the software under test. Additionally, the bugs have to be validated
                            with the developers for them to fix.</p>
                        <p><b>Risks and Contingencies:</b> Risks associated during the testing should be clearly
                            mentioned and proper contingencies during the time have to be defined very clearly.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h4 id="test_execution_plan">Test Execution Plan</h4>
                        <p>The execution of test cases is one of the steps in the STLC phase. This will have to be
                            performed in accordance with the plans that were worked out earlier. Hence, planning always
                            keeps dominating the whole of the testing phase. Below is an example where the testing team
                            gets impacted by the changes in the testing plans.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Observations:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The testing plan will determine the test case execution.</li>
                            <li>The execution part varies as per the plan.</li>
                            <li>As long as the plan and the requirements are valid the test cases are valid too.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Ways to Overcome Problems while Execution</h5>
                        <p>Testers will more often come across various scenarios while they perform the test execution.
                            This is when the testers will have to understand and know the ways to resolve the problem or
                            at least find a workaround for the issue.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Version Controlling and Management</h5>
                        <p>Version Controlling and management of testing plans and the test cases are really important
                            in order to showcase the timely deliverables. This is being more significant and is often
                            done with the help of a version control tool.

                        <p>A version control tool not only helps them to control the testing plans but also assists in
                            defects management. When there are testing projects with multiple cycles and releases, these
                            tools can really help a lot in bringing down the metrics for supporting the testing
                            deliverables.

                        <p>You already know that making a Test Plan is the most important task of Test Management
                            Process. Follow the seven
                            steps below to create a test plan as per IEEE 829.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Analyze the product</li>
                            <li>Design the Test Strategy</li>
                            <li>Define the Test Objectives</li>
                            <li>Define Test Criteria</li>
                            <li>Resource Planning</li>

                        </ol>
                        <h5>1. Analyze the product</h5>
                        <p>How can you test a product without any information about it? The answer is Impossible. You
                            must learn a product
                            thoroughly before testing it.</p>
                        <p>You should take a look around this website and also review product documentation. Review of
                            product documentation
                            helps you to understand all the features of the website as well as how to use it. If you are
                            unclear on any
                            items, you might interview customer, developer, designer to get more information.</p>

                        <h5>2. Develop Test Strategy</h5>
                        <p>Test Strategy is a critical step in making a Test Plan in Software Testing. A Test Strategy
                            document, is a
                            high-level document, which is usually developed by Test Manager. This document defines:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The projectâ€™s testing objectives and the means to achieve them</li>
                            <li>Determines testing effort and costs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><a href="../projects/test-strategy.html">You can check this article to read more about test
                                strategy.</a></p>

                        <h5>3. Define Test Objective</h5>
                        <p>Test Objective is the overall goal and achievement of the test execution. The objective of
                            the testing is finding
                            as many software defects as possible; ensure that the software under test is bug free before
                            release.</p>
                        <p>To define the test objectives, you should do 2 following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>List all the software features (functionality, performance, GUIâ€¦) which may need to
                                test.</li>
                            <li>Define the target or the goal of the test based on above features</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You can choose the â€˜TOP-DOWNâ€™ method to find the websiteâ€™s features which may need to test.
                            In this method, you
                            break down the application under test to component and sub-component.</p>
                        <p>Also, you can create a Mind-Map to find the website features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check that whether website functionality (Account, Depositâ€¦) is working as expected
                                without any error or
                                bugs in real business environment</li>
                            <li>Check that the external interface of the website such as UI is working as expected and &
                                meet the customer
                                need</li>
                            <li>Verify the usability of the website. Are those functionalities convenient for user or
                                not?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4. Define Test Criteria</h5>
                        <p>Test Criteria is a standard or rule on which a test procedure or test judgment can be based.
                            Thereâ€™re 2 types of
                            test criteria as following.</p>
                        <p><b>Suspension Criteria</b>
                        <p>
                        <p>Specify the critical suspension criteria for a test. If the suspension criteria are met
                            during testing, the
                            active test cycle will be suspended until the criteria are resolved.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>Test Plan Example:</i> If your team members report that there are 40% of test cases
                            failed, you should suspend
                            testing until the development team fixes all the failed cases.</p>
                        <p><b>Exit Criteria</b>
                        <p>
                        <p>It specifies the criteria that denote a successful completion of a test phase. The exit
                            criteria are the targeted
                            results of the test and are necessary before proceeding to the next phase of development.
                            Example: 95% of all
                            critical test cases must pass.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some methods of defining exit criteria are by specifying a targeted run rate and pass rate.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Run rate is ratio between number test cases executed/total test cases of test
                                specification. For example,
                                the test specification has total 120 TCs, but the tester only executed 100 TCs, So the
                                run rate is 100/120 =
                                0.83 (83%)</li>
                            <li>Pass rate is ratio between numbers test cases passed / test cases executed. For example,
                                in above 100 TCs
                                executed, thereâ€™re 80 TCs that passed, so the pass rate is 80/100 = 0.8 (80%)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This data can be retrieved in Test Metric documents.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Run rate is mandatory to be 100% unless a clear reason is given.</li>
                            <li>Pass rate is dependent on project scope, but achieving high pass rate is a goal.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>5. Resource Planning</h5>
                        <p>Resource plan is a detailed summary of all types of resources required to complete project
                            task. Resource could
                            be human, equipment and materials needed to complete a project.</p>
                        <p>The resource planning is important factor of the test planning because helps in determining
                            the number of
                            resources (employee, equipmentâ€¦) to be used for the project. Therefore, the Test Manager can
                            make the correct
                            schedule & estimation for the project.</p>

                        <p>A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware on which the testing team is going
                            to execute test
                            cases. The test environment consists of real business and user environment, as well as
                            physical environments,
                            such as server, front end running environment.</p>

                        <p>Back to your project, how do you set up test environment for this banking website?</p>
                        <p>To finish this task, you need a strong cooperation between Test Team and Development Team.
                        </p>
                        <p>You should ask the developer some questions to understand the web application under test
                            clearly. Hereâ€™re some
                            recommended questions. Of course, you can ask the other questions if you need.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the maximum user connection which this website can handle at the same time?</li>
                            <li>What are hardware/software requirements to install this website?</li>
                            <li>Does the userâ€™s computer need any particular setting to browse the website?</li>

                        <p>To create the project schedule, the Test Manager needs several types of input as below:</p>
                        <p><b>Employee and project deadline:</b> The working days, the project deadline, resource
                            availability are the
                            factors which affected to the schedule</p>
                        <p><b>Project estimation:</b> Base on the estimation, the Test Manager knows how long it takes
                            to complete the
                            project. So, he can make the appropriate project schedule</p>
                        <p><b>Project Risk:</b> Understanding the risk helps Test Manager add enough extra time to the
                            project schedule

                            and how we can execute these plans efficiently. In this article, we discussed the test plan
                            for software testing. We first discussed its definition, objectives, advantages, the method
                            to implement it, and creating a template for it.
