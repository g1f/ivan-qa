                        <p>By ISTQB glossary the definition of a test strategy is – a high-level description of the test
                            levels to be performed
                            and the testing within those levels for an organization or programme (one or more projects).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process of writing a test strategy is more about thinking about risk factors within the
                            project and planning to
                            mitigate those risks, rather than ticking boxes to show that all types of testing have been
                            included.

                        <h5>1. Analytical strategy</h5>
                        <p>An analytical test strategy is the most common strategy, it might be based on requirements
                            (in user acceptance
                            testing, for example), specifications (in system or component testing), or risks (in a
                            proper risk-based testing
                            strategy).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a more agile approach, it might be based on none of those, but a common understanding of
                            user stories, or even a
                            mind-map. The point is not the form of the test basis, but that there is a specific test
                            basis for the release that
                            is analyzed to form a set of tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, in case of testing based on requirements, requirements are analyzed to derive the test
                            conditions. Then tests
                            are designed, implemented and executed to meet those requirements.
                            Even the results are recorded with respect to requirements, like requirements tested and
                            passed, those that were
                            tested but failed and those requirements which are not fully tested, etc.

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h5>2. Model based strategy</h5>
                        <p>An increasingly popular strategy is a model-based test strategy. This combines
                            specification-based testing with
                            structure-based testing to create some model of how the software should work. This might be
                            a diagram that shows
                            the user route taken through a website, or a diagram that shows how different technical
                            components integrate, or
                            both!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a really interesting strategy because it allows for the best tool support. Creating
                            a machine-readable
                            model of the application, allows tools to generate manual or automated tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The models are also developed according to existing software, hardware, data speeds,
                            infrastructure, etc.

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h5>3. Methodical Test Strategies</h5>
                        <p>A methodical test strategy is when you use a standard test basis for different applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This might be for instance, because you test payments and the payment scheme provides a set
                            of mandatory tests for a particular type of transaction in system testing. Or, it might be
                            because you are doing application security testing and want to leverage the industry
                            experience baked into the OWASP Application Security Testing framework. In case of
                            maintenance testing, a checklist describing important functions, their attributes, etc. is
                            sufficient to perform the tests.
                        </p>

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h5>4. Standards or process compliant strategy</h5>
                        <p>Standards compliant test strategies are where you use industry standards to decide what to
                            test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is most likely where you are in a specific regulated sector, like self-driving cars, or
                            aviation, where
                            there are specific standards you have to meet for testing. For example, code coverage in
                            system testing might be
                            a requirement, or testing specific scenarios in user acceptance testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the case of a project following Scrum Agile technique, testers will create its complete
                            test strategy,
                            starting from identifying test criteria, defining test cases, executing tests, report status
                            etc. around each
                            user stories.

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h5>5. Reactive Test Strategies</h5>
                        <p>Reactive test strategies are where you decide what to test when you receive the software.
                            This can happen in
                            exploratory testing, where things you observe on your testing journey drive further tests.
                            So testing is based
                            on defects found in actual system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another example is metamorphic testing of machine learning, which you could argue is
                            reactive as one test
                            depends on the next.
                        </p>

                    <article class="article-section">
                        <h5>6. Consultative strategy</h5>
                        <p>The name suggests, this testing technique uses consultations from key stakeholders as input
                            to decide the scope
                            of test conditions as in the case of user directed testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sure, there’s scenarios where the functionality was too complex for me to understand and I
                            had to ask other
                            people about how to test, but I still applied test design techniques to what they said in my
                            system testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The testers may then use different techniques like testing pair wise or equivalence
                            partitioning techniques
                            depending upon priority of the items in the provided lists.

                        <p><strong>Test planning:</strong> The testing team will review the requirements and develop a
                            test plan that
                            outlines the testing scope, objectives, and timelines specific to functionalities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Test design:</strong> The testing team will develop test cases and test scenarios
                            based on the
                            requirements and user stories. Test data will be identified, and test environments will be
                            set up.</p>
                        <p><strong>Test execution:</strong> The test cases will be executed using manual and automated
                            testing techniques.
                            The testing team will report and track defects, and retest fixed defects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Test reporting:</strong> The testing team will prepare and share test reports that
                            summarize the testing
                            progress, the number of defects, and the overall quality of the application.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Functional testing:</strong> This type of testing ensures that the application
                            functions correctly
                            according to the requirements. It includes the testing of user registration, account
                            transactions,
                            balance inquiries, bill payments, and loan applications.</p>

                            responsiveness, stability, and
                            scalability under different load conditions for transactions (eg. if we test banking
                            application).</p>
                        <p><strong>Security testing: </strong> This type of testing ensures that the application is
                            secure from
                            unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compatibility testing: </strong> This type of testing checks if the application
                            functions
                            correctly across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.</p>

                        <p>In Software Engineering, software release goes through Test Strategy documents from time to
                            time to map the progress
                            of testing in the right direction. When the release date is close many of these activities
                            will be skipped, it is
                            desirable to discuss with team members whether cutting down any particular activity will
                            help for release without
                            any potential risk.
